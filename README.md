# uni-stuttgart-beamer-template

This is an unofficial L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X template for Beamer
presentations by and for members of the University of Stuttgart,
Germany, following the new corporate design the university has given
itself in 2016.

The template is private work by members of the University of Stuttgart.
It is not endorsed by the University of Stuttgart or any of its
institutions, institutes, or departments.
The template is made available to the public as we think it might
be useful for other people.
Neither the authors nor the University of Stuttgart provide support
for the template going beyond this `README`.

The license for the template is located in `LICENSE`.

If you happen to improve the template, it would be nice if you merged
back your work using pull requests.
